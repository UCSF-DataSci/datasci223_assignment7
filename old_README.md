# Assignment 6: Neural Networks and Health Data Analysis

## Overview

This assignment introduces neural networks and their applications in healthcare data analysis. You'll work through three parts:

1. **Basic Neural Networks**: Implement a simple neural network for EMNIST character recognition
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Build a CNN for more complex image classification
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Apply neural networks to ECG signal classification

## Learning Objectives

- Implement and train neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras and/or Pytorch
- Apply CNNs for image classification
- Work with time series data using RNNs
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Interpret results in a healthcare context

## Setup

## Part 1: Neural Networks Basics

- Implement a simple neural network for EMNIST character recognition
- Use dense layers, activation functions, and dropout
- Save model as `models/emnist_classifier.keras`
- Save metrics in `results/part_1/emnist_classifier_metrics.txt`

Goals:
- Achieve > 80% accuracy on test set
- Minimize overfitting using dropout
- Train efficiently with appropriate batch size

## Part 2: CNN Classification

- Implement a CNN for EMNIST classification
- Choose between TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Save model as:
    - TensorFlow: `models/cnn_keras.keras`
    - PyTorch: `models/cnn_pytorch.pt` and `models/cnn_pytorch_arch.txt`
- Save metrics in `results/part_2/cnn_{framework}_metrics.txt`

Goals:
- Achieve > 85% accuracy on test set
- Minimize overfitting using batch normalization and dropout
- Train efficiently with appropriate batch size and learning rate

## Part 3: ECG Analysis

- Work with MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
- Choose between simple neural network or RNN/LSTM
- Save model as `models/ecg_classifier_{model_type}.keras`
- Save metrics in `results/part_3/ecg_classifier_{model_type}_metrics.txt`

Goals:
- Achieve > 75% accuracy on test set
- Achieve AUC > 0.80
- Achieve F1-score > 0.70
- Minimize overfitting using appropriate techniques
- Train efficiently with appropriate batch size

## Framework Options

1. **TensorFlow/Keras**:
   - Simpler syntax and more examples
   - Save models as `.keras` files

2. **PyTorch**:
   - Better for research and customization
   - Save models as `.pt` files with architecture in separate `.txt` file

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Problem: Dataset not found
   - Solution: Check directory structure and download scripts

2. **Model Training**:
   - Problem: Training instability
   - Solution: Use batch normalization, reduce learning rate
   - Problem: Overfitting
   - Solution: Increase dropout, use data augmentation

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Problem: Metrics format incorrect
   - Solution: Follow the exact format specified
   - Problem: Model performance below threshold
   - Solution: Adjust architecture, hyperparameters
